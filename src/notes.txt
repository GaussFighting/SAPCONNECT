1. Pls, remove redundant files :)
2. You have very up to date packages :D Well done :D
3. Good, old school way notation for constant values, i.e. for /other-orders - you could create a file like "constants.js" :)
I.e. 
export PATH_OTHER_ORDERS = "/other-orders" 
It looks like an overkill, but it saves hours of debugging due to a typos :D
